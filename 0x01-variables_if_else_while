C - Variables, if, else, while

0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
The output of the program should be:
The number, followed by
if the number is greater than 0: is positive
if the number is 0: is zero
if the number is less than 0: is negative
followed by a new line
1. The last digit
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
The output of the program should be:
The string Last digit of, followed by
n, followed by
The string is, followed by
if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
followed by a new line
